## **ICASSP 2025 DFCUP: Generalized Deepfake Detection**
ðŸ“„ **[Paper / Report](icassp_2025/ICASSP_Deepfake_Detection.pdf)**  

This research presents a **generalized deepfake detection approach** combining **CLIP (Vision-Language Model)** for semantic feature extraction and **ResNet101 (CNN)** for hierarchical image analysis. Our **domain-independent dataset** and **feature fusion methodology** enhance robustness against diverse deepfake techniques. Achieving **91.24% accuracy**, **0.0391 Detection Cost Function (DCF)**, and **8.73% Equal Error Rate (EER)**, our model demonstrates adaptability and efficacy in an evolving media landscape.
